Understanding Consumption Patterns in Croatia Through Time Series Analysis
# An Econometric Analysis of Consumption Drivers in Croatia (1990–2023)

This project investigates the macroeconomic factors influencing consumption in Croatia using time series econometrics and Stata.

## Dataset

Variables included:
- consumption 
- exports 
- gdp 
- taxes 
- imports

## Methods

- Exports show a particularly strong association with consumption trends in Croatia between 1990 and 2023.
